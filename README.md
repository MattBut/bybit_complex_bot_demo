🤖 Crypto Trading Simulator BotThis guide provides instructions for setting up and running the Crypto Investment Data Aggregator Bot, a Python-based trading simulator that uses technical indicators (specifically EMA) and risk-based volume calculation.PrerequisitesPython 3.9+A Bybit account (or Testnet account) for API access.Reliable internet connection.🛠️ Section 1: Installation & Project Setup1.1. Project InitializationClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create & Activate Virtual Environment:Bashpython3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:Bashpip install pandas pandas-ta numpy python-dotenv pybit openpyxl
Place Indicator Files:Ensure the supporting indicator files (e.g., ema_indicator.py) are located correctly in the indicators/ subdirectory:/indicators/ema_indicator.py1.2. API Configuration (.env file)For security, the bot loads API keys from a .env file. Create this file in the root directory and add your Bybit credentials:Ini, TOML# .env file content
BYBIT_API_KEY="YOUR_BYBIT_API_KEY"
BYBIT_API_SECRET="YOUR_BYBIT_API_SECRET"
⚙️ Section 2: Bot Configuration & Risk ManagementAll core trading parameters are set directly in the main script (main.py).2.1. Global SettingsSettingCode VariableDefaultDescriptionActive StrategySTRATEGY_TYPE1Selects the indicator (1 = EMA).Initial BalanceDEFAULT_BALANCE10000Starting balance for simulation (saved to balance.txt).Risk per TradeRISK_PER_TRADE_USDT1.0CRITICAL: Maximum loss in USDT the bot risks per trade.Trading ModeTRADING_MODE20=LONG ONLY, 1=SHORT ONLY, 2=BOTH.Liquidity FilterMIN_VOLUME_24H150,000,000Minimum 24-hour volume required for a pair to be considered.2.2. Strategy Parameters (EMA Example)The following parameters are defined in EMA_PARAMS (or other strategy-specific maps) and control the trade entry/exit logic:ParameterDefaultDescriptionSL_PERCENT0.8Stop Loss percentage (used for risk calculation).TP_PERCENT1.0Take Profit percentage.EMA_FAST_LENGTH10Fast EMA period.EMA_SLOW_LENGTH20Slow EMA period.KLINE_INTERVAL'60'Data interval (e.g., '60' for 1 hour).CATEGORY'linear'Bybit market category (linear or spot).2.3. Risk CalculationThe bot calculates the volume of the position based on the global risk budget and the strategy's defined Stop Loss percentage. This ensures that a move to the Stop Loss price results in a loss no greater than RISK_PER_TRADE_USDT.🚀 Section 3: Running the Bot3.1. ExecutionTo start the main trading loop:Bashsource venv/bin/activate
python main.py
The console will output the startup parameters and current balance.3.2. Console and AccountingThe bot generates and maintains the following files in the root directory for accounting:balance.txt: Stores the current balance of the simulator.trade_history.xlsx: A detailed Excel log of every closed trade (using openpyxl), including PnL, entry/exit times, and prices.🛑 Troubleshooting"Strategy is not implemented" Error: Ensure STRATEGY_TYPE in main.py matches an existing key in the PARAMS_MAP dictionary (currently only 1 is supported in this file).API Errors: Double-check that the BYBIT_API_KEY and BYBIT_API_SECRET in your .env file are correct and have appropriate permissions (Read-only for market data, Trade for placing orders if this were live).Missing Logs: If trade_history.xlsx is not created, check that the openpyxl dependency is installed correctly (pip install openpyxl).
